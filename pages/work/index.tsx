In this entry, I was one of the main artists in which I focused primarily on background design, from the level design to the city hub, to the cutscenes; I also contributed with a few profiles for the characters and various animations. My work involved making concept art for the levels, backgrounds and even a few character designs, as well as making the finished artwork for all these assets. It\'s been one of my most ambitious projects yet and a dream come true being able to work in a video game.',

Other hobbies also involve using traditional media, such as colored pencils, markers and watercolors making concept art of various characters or background design.',
